  <p>
    Welcome to my blog! I am currently looking for a sofware
    engineering position. I have a lot of experience in 
    React.js, JavaScript, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.

    I have currently been working on some React projects and 
    freelancing. Linkedin Learning is a great tool to use if 
    you are wanting to become a better coder.
